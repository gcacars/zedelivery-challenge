ZÃ© Delivery front-end code challenge


## Requirements

- 

## Compatibility

Desktop: Edge 16+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 49+, Safari 9.1+, Opera 36+  
Mobile: iOS Safari, Samsung Internet, Chrome and Firefox for Android

## Notes

Developed without requirement of package manager and dependencies.
Ultra simple, old style code, but without full support for Internet Explorer.
A world with Vue CLI, Webpack, ES6, modules, async/await would be a better place :)
