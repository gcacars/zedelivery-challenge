# Zé Delivery challenge

Zé Delivery front-end code challenge.

## Challenge

It's simple. The user needs to type an address inside a field and be redirected to a products list page. So your job as a front-end engineer will be to create 2 simple screens consuming and sending data to our API.

- Home:
  - Needs to have a header, a footer and a input for the user to fill up with the address.
- Products page:
  - We want to see the products as cards, with the product title, price and buttons to add/remove the product.

## Requirements

- Avoid using scaffolds
- Keep it simple
- It's not allowed to use any CSS Frameworks
- I want to be able to run your project locally by using `npm start`

## Compatibility

Desktop: Edge 16+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 49+, Safari 9.1+, Opera 36+  
Mobile: iOS Safari, Samsung Internet, Chrome and Firefox for Android

## Notes

Developed without requirement of package manager and your dependencies.
Ultra simple, old school code, but without  support for Internet Explorer.
A world with Vue CLI, Webpack, ES6, modules, async/await would be a better place :)
